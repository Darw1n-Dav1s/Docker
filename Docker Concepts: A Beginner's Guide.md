### What is Docker?

  Docker is a platform used to develop, ship, and run applications in lightweight, portable environments called containers. 
  
  Think of a container as a mini-computer that includes everything your application needs to run — code, libraries, settings, and system tools — all bundled together.

### Why Use Docker?

* **Portability**
    Containers run the same way on your local machine, testing server, and production server.

* **Isolation**
    Each container runs in its own isolated environment, which avoids conflicts between applications.

* **Efficiency**
    Containers are lightweight — they share the same OS kernel and use fewer resources compared to virtual machines.

* **Speed**
    Start-up time is very fast; containers can be launched in seconds.

### Key Concepts

1. **Image**

    An image is a snapshot or blueprint of a container. It defines what software is inside, which OS it uses, and how it should run.
        Example: nginx:alpine — this image runs the Nginx web server using Alpine Linux (a small Linux distro).

2. **Container**

    A container is a running instance of an image. It’s isolated from the host and from other containers.
    Think of it as a live app based on a specific image.

3. **Dockerfile**

     A text file with step-by-step instructions to build an image.
   
    example:
   
          FROM python:3.11-slim

          RUN pip install flask
   
          COPY app.py /app/
   
          CMD ["python", "/app/app.py"]

5. **Docker Hub**

    A public repository of Docker images — like GitHub for Docker.
    You can pull images from Docker Hub or push your own.

6. **Volumes**

    Volumes are used for persistent storage. If a container stops or is removed, its internal data is lost — unless stored in a volume.

7. **Networks**

     Docker networks allow containers to communicate with each other. Each container gets a private IP, and you can create isolated networks for security.
   
8. **Bind Mount**
   
     Maps a specific file or folder on the host to the container.

9. **Registry**
    
    A place to store and distribute images (e.g., Docker Hub).

   
10. **Docker Compose**
    
    A tool to define and manage multi-container apps.
    
11. **Layer**
    
    Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer. Docker caches these for efficiency.
    
12. **EntryPoint**
    
    The command that runs when the container starts.

13. **CMD**
    
    Provides default arguments to the ENTRYPOINT.   
        

### How Does Docker Work?
  - You write a Dockerfile that describes your application environment.
  - Docker builds an image using this Dockerfile.
  - You run the image to create a container.
  - You can manage the container’s lifecycle (start, stop, remove), expose it to the internet, mount storage for persistent data, or link it with other containers to form a multi-service application.
